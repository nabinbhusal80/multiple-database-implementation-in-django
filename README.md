# multiple-database-implementation-in-django
It is about implementing separate databases for the separate apps with one default database for the authentication purposes. 
## Multiple Databases
For this project i am only using the sqlite databases however one can use postgres sql and mongo db as well. 
Keep checking out my github i will be posting separate projects on that as well.
